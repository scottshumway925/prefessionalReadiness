Compass Workview and Lifeview
- Why do you work?
- What is the purpose and meaning of life?
- What is the role of your emotions and your success?

Where do your views of work and life complement against each other?
My views of work any life complement each other through their dependence upon each other. I view life as something that I can succeed it. I need to be striving to find joy and to bring that joy to others. This is accomplished by working with other people. 

Where do they clash?
These views clash in how I implement them. I strive to get out of work in many situations, or to do the minimum amount of work necessary in some situations. This causes my life to not measure up to what I hope it to be.

Does one drive the other? How?
They drive each other through the theoretical views that I carry with them. If I want a good lifeview, then I need to improve my workview. If I want my work to feel meaningful, then I need a good lifeview.
